-->Goals
  -->Achievable
    -->Create a websocket server, which run on http server. Reason I do not know, may be I'll learn something
      -->Recive & Send messages in JSON. Why may be It will be helpfull in future, to connect data base
        -->Brodcast messages to end-end users. It has to be in JSON
         -->Store Users message in db. Why It will probably used in future.
   
   -->Hard To Achieve but It is not impossible
    -->Understanding how users are connecting, have to check ws code. I'll learn a lot
     -->If any of the user got disconneted another brodcasted user must know about it. (Most important feature)
      -->Asking end user name and assigning a ID to that user, and storing his/her messages according to that id. 
        | why, so end user can edit messages. (This feature will be built in upcoming months if doable...)

-->Oct 3 - 9 
  -->First Four feature, and learn them perfectly understand why it is working. And how it is working...

-->Oct 9-31
   -->Remaining features, it depends on the goals, first achieve the firt of them.


Total 5 hours
   -->First 3 hours, code refactor and learn 
     -->Second 2 hours, learn about websocket and ws package docs.
       -->If not give fours to code...


//It has to perfect, if not the perfect....

-->Execution //First goal//
 -->Oct - 4 to Oct - 15

  -->Create a websocket server, which run on http server. Reason I do not know, may be I'll learn something
    |--> It does not mean just copy the syntax, under stand what is happening by looking ws docs..

  -->Recive & Send messages in JSON. Why may be It will be helpfull in future, to connect data base
    |--> Understand why JSON is used.
  
  -->Brodcast messages to end-end users. It has to be in JSON --> Done..
    |--> Understand the code. Until you've reached to phsyical point.

    //Secondary Goals, achieve it next six days. Three goals Two days each//

|--> It does not mean just copy the syntax, under stand what is happening by looking ws docs..
|--> Understand why JSON is used.
|--> Understand the code. Until you've reached to phsyical point. (Most Important out of all three, if possible try to write your own logic. By understanding docs code)

-->First one how wss.on is working? How it is connecting to websocket?


-->Oct-4 - Oct-6
  -->Create a ws.on, and under stand how it is working, in deeper level...
  //First Day//
  -->Create a websocket file and, basic wss.on and see how it works. And build it on json.. -->Done
    -->Explore docs, and figure out, what is happening
